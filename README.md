Step 1: Set Up and Planning
    1. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
    2. Set up your Git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).
    3. Download a full-resolution copy of the project design file and get a general idea for how youâ€™re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.

Step 2: Layout
    1. Start by writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers.
    2. In your CSS file, apply Grid properties until you have this basic layout built.
